### How to Approaching a Dynamic Programming Problem

#### 1.Memoization Recipe
- Recursive approach => think about the tree
- Find the base case then add memo for obtimizations

#### 2.Tabulation Recipe
- Table approach 
- table size base on input and initialize the table with default value (look from the answer)
- find initial first result value (seed)
- current postion base on past values in other words further position based on the current position.
